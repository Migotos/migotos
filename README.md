# Migotos.com

A site for my mothers cat breeding company: *Migotoâ€™s Norwegian Forest Cat*, cattery based in Oslo, Norway.

The data for this site was originally scraped from an old Wordpress site using my own webscraper written in Python. There was a little over 25_000 images, 52 cat profiles, 83 litters and 67 blogposts. Then the data is inserted into a MySQL database The scraper source code can you find here: [migotos-webscraper](https://github.com/sommeeeer/migotos-webscraper)

This project was built to make it easier for my mum to add new content to her site. Also migrating from a static blog site([old migotos](https://oldsite.migotos.com)) to a more modern dynamic NextJS web application with SSG and revalidation for most of the pages, with an admin dashboard.
